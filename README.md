# Common Core

## About

A repository to explore developing guidance and validation around common graph shapes
to facilitate federated use of implementing Knowledge Graphs.

## SPARQL 1.1 Federates Search via Service?

So, while it is true this approach should allow SPARQL queries to be formed that 
can be federated via SERVICE, see [https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/)
for details, this is not the only or even primary goal.  

Additional approaches would include being able to form SPARQL CONSTRUCT calls to form new 
triples or leveraging approach to subset or frame out data from a parent graph into 
a useful subset of triples for specific communities or use cases.  

The goal here is not to promote any given approach to use the graphs that validate 
to this common core shape, but rather simply ensure that whatever approach is developed and used
can be operating against know graph shapes.
