# What is _Common Core_

Common Core (CC) is a collaborative effort between the involved parties to 
express  alignment approaches for their respective Knowledge Graphs.  It is not
intended this be the only or even the most capable approach to such alignment, 
it most surely will not be. 

Additionally, it should be noted that alignment can be both a technical and social 
thing.  Elements of this work will touch on both.  

In the above context then, CC is a mechanism to seek alignment between involved parties
to enable better use of the resources from the represented communities across
a wide surface of users.   

Technical alignment exist at many layers.

## Representation

JSON-LD and HTTP along with robots.txt, sitemaps and sitegraphs

Most of these above items can be seen as simple applications of web architecture approaches.


## Vocabulary

schema.org, geosparql, DCAT, other?   

It may be possible to leverage VOID, schema.org or Hydra to represent the vocabularies used.
However, since the SHACL shapes will validate against the use of vocabularies explicitly this may
really not be needed.   Rather it might be easy to "grep" the shapes for the range of vocabularies used. 

## Activity representation

PROV


## Query representation

SPARQL

## Validation 

SHACL

## Relationship to FAIR (or CARE?)

TBD
